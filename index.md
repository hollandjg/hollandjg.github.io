I'm John Gerrard Holland, a British-German physicist with experience in management consultantancy and IT. I'm passionate about climate and sustainability.

I live in Massachusetts, USA, and my home base is in Munich, Germany.

I studied physics and astronomy at Durham University and carried out doctoral research at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching bei München. I defended [my thesis](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/18349/
 "'Optical and X-ray structures in the REXCESS sample of galaxy clusters' LMU München Universitätsbibliothek") in June 2015.
