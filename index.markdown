I'm a British-German research software engineer at [Brown University's Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu). 

From 2007 to 2011 I studied physics and astronomy at Durham University. I wrote a [demonstration of 2D Fourier Transforms](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/2DFourierTransforms/) for the modern optics course.

From 2011 to 2015 I wrote my doctoral thesis at the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://mpe.mpg.de) in Garching bei München and the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/). I defended [my thesis, *"Optical and X-ray structures in the REXCESS sample of galaxy clusters"*](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/18349/) in June 2015. 

From 2016 to 2021 I was a management and IT consultant at [Basycon Unternehmensberatung GmbH](https://www.basycon.com). I worked in the planning and execution of IT-projects, including acquisition, planning, budgeting, project & program management, team leadership, recruiting and mentorship. I worked at the interface between business domain experts and IT operations teams, and helped improve coding standards at my company, pushing for modern IDEs, source control, and testing.

Since 2022 I've been a research software engineer at at [Brown University's Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu). As of January 2024, I manage a team of software engineers and data scientists, supporting cutting edge research at Brown University. I provide training and guidance for my team, and assist the directors of the center with project acquisition and management. I've worked on projects including [automating the process of running psychological experiements][autora], AI alignment, [analyzing remote sensing data from Earth observation satellites][ice-floes], and building a [website framework][project-portal] for local and state governments in the USA to publicise their public policy initiatives.

In my free time, I enjoy music and the great outdoors. During my doctorate, I danced [acrobatic Rock'n'Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzb0DIRF4Zk) with [Fly'n'Dance Freising](https://flyndance.de). I was also member of the [Musikverein St. Andreas Eching e.V](https://mv-eching.de), where I directed the youth wind band. From 2018–2020 I was the pianist and musical director for a small band which played once a month in Munich for the [Sunday Assembly](https://www.sundayassembly.org). These days I play piano and like to explore New England with my wonderful wife.
