![Mark and John in front of snow covered trees. Mark looks like he's just been rained on, and is wearing a small christmas hat on his hat, and a knitted red, green and white wintery jumper. John is smiling like a lunatic and has a european robin on his head. A star of wonder shines over Mark's head and there's a glowing comet in the sky too. In front of John and Mark there are pine cones, berries and green branches and a present wrapped in red foil with golden stars and a golden bow.](./cover-art.png)

Mark Walker and John Holland are the jazz duo **Fix It In Post**.
We play bass and piano.
And we take it very seriously.
