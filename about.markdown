I'm a British-German research software engineer at [Brown University's Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu). 

From 2007 to 2011 I studied physics and astronomy at Durham University. I wrote a [demonstration of 2D Fourier Transforms](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/2DFourierTransforms/) for the modern optics course.

From 2011 to 2015 I wrote my doctoral thesis at the [Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics](https://mpe.mpg.de) in Garching bei MÃ¼nchen and the [Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/). I defended [my thesis, *"Optical and X-ray structures in the REXCESS sample of galaxy clusters"*](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/18349/) in June 2015. 

I danced [acrobatic Rock'n'Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzb0DIRF4Zk) with [Fly'n'Dance Freising](https://flyndance.de) from 2011 to 2016. From 2012 to 2015 I was a member of the [Musikverein St. Andreas Eching e.V](https://mv-eching.de), where I directed the youth wind band.

From 2016 to 2021 I was a management and IT consultant at [Basycon Unternehmensberatung GmbH](https://www.basycon.com).
